## Shroud of the Forsaken

Shroud of the Forsaken is a 2.5D hack-n-slash RPG written from the ground up in C. It was made by a team of four coders over a period of four months. It was my first game project as an undergrad at DigiPen. I ported the game to javascript for the purposes of education and promotion.
